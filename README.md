### Hi there, _Assalamu'alaikum_.. ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ainan. Currently working in **Linux/FLOSS**, **Digital Marketing** and **Programming** field. Mostly in teaching and freelancing.

### 1. In Digital Marketing, 

I like **writing** various content ranging from:

    article post, SEO content, review, documentation, sripture, caption, status update, poem, copywriting and many more.

Right now, I'm trying to start a YouTube channel, Ainando Kei.

### In Linux and FLOSS (Free, Legal, Open Source Software), 

I'm familiar with Debian-based linux distribution with experience in:

### In Programming, 

Right now, I'm actively code in this language:

2. Javascript -> scripting, front-end development
3. PHP -> scripting, blogging, web development
4. Dart -> Flutter app development

And sometimes still code for this language during spare time or based on project:
